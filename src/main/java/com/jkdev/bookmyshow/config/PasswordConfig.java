/*
    - A Spring bean is any object whose lifecycle (creation, dependency injection, configuration, and destruction) is managed
      by the Spring IoC container. You get inversion of control: you ask Spring for dependencies instead of instantiating them manually.
    - @Bean registers the returned object as a Spring-managed bean.
    - @Bean marks a method inside a @Configuration class whose return value is registered in the Spring ApplicationContext.
      Default scope is singleton, so only one BCryptPasswordEncoder instance is created and reused (no extra singleton code needed).
    - Without this bean, Spring cannot inject the encoder into UserService unless another configuration autoâ€‘provides it.
